# TopStories 
A simple reader app, displaying the top stories from the New York Times.

The project uses Carthage to manage dependencies, so you'll probably want to install that if you haven't already.

Setup should be as simple as;

- Install Carthage
- Run `carthage update`
- Open TopStories.xcodeproj

Let me know if you have any difficulties loading the project.
